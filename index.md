# Final Milestone
My final Milestone is the final product of the whole project. This includes the final code which has all of the movements for the led's as well as the different levels with increasing difficulty as you play the game. It also has the led fully wraping around the ring I built, with all the wires connected to their corresponding parts based off of the code. With all of this connected, this comes together as the final prduct for my project, a complete running game.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was to get the LED and the button connected to the Arduino. First, I made sure to have the LED working and focused first on just getting that to light up. Next, I worked on getting the button to also be connected to the Arduino. Then I ran the code that I needed so that the LED would light up and change colors at the click of the button.
