# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was to get the led and the button connected to the arduino. First, I made sure to have the led working and focused first on just getting thst to light up. Next, I worked on getting the button to also be connected to the arduino. Then I ran the code that I needed so that the led would light up and change colors at the click of the button.
